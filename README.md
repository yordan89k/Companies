 An ASP.NET MVC5 1-week project with functionalities such as:

- User can Create, Edit, Delete, see Details of companies and stores in a local SQP DataBase
- Validations on user input when creating Store
- Geocoding when creating a Store (Controller automatically gets Longitude and Latitude of address through Google API).
- User selects a company from a list so the Backend can bind its Unique ID and the new store's Foreign Key
- Drop down menu with existing companies' names on Store Edit page (View Model)

Expect improvements and new functions in near future.

# Further Improvements and Upgrades:
- 2020-Feb-7: Got rid of a lot of unnecessary code in the Geocoding method, including a JavaScript Section on Create Page.   
- 2020-Feb-13: Included more validation rules and removed the ones from HTML attributes so all is at one place
